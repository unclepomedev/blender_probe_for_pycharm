## Automated Code Review

This project utilizes **CodeRabbit AI** to assist with code reviews. Its purpose is to catch potential bugs and suggest improvements early in the process.

However, AI suggestions should be treated as **optional advice**, not mandatory requirements.
* If the AI makes a mistake or gives a false positive, please disregard it or explain why in the comments.
* **Final decisions are always made by human reviewers.** Do not feel pressured to implement every suggestion made by the bot.
